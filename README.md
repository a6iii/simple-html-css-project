HTML Explanation
  The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines the document as HTML5.
  The <meta charset="UTF-8"> ensures proper text encoding.
  The <meta name="viewport"> makes the webpage responsive on all devices.
  The <div class="container"> wraps the image and name.
  The <img> tag is used to display the image.
  The <h2> tag displays the name below the image.
CSS Explanation
   Body Styling
display: flex is used to enable Flexbox.
justify-content: center and align-items: center center the content horizontally and vertically.
height: 100vh makes the content fill the full screen height.
A light green background color is applied.
